Welcome!!! I am an Assistant Professor in Sociology at Columbia University and a member of the Data Science Institute. My research draws from the literatures on urban sociology, stratification, and criminology, and it focuses on understanding how the spatial  organization of the American stratification system creates and reproduces inequalities. My current research agenda investigates (1) how the neighborhood context, particularly the experience of community violence, determines the life chances of children; (2) how social capital and social organization emerge and evolve in spatial contexts; and (3) how place and geography structure educational and economic opportunity in America and elsewhere. My work has been published in the *American Sociological Review*, *Child Development*, *Demography*, *Eastern Economic Journal*, *Housing Policy Debate*, the *Journal of Housing Economics*, the *Journal of Urban Economics*, and the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. I received my PhD in Sociology from New York University in 2019, a Masterâ€™s in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2014, and a BS in Engineering from Polytechnic University of Catalonia in 2004.
