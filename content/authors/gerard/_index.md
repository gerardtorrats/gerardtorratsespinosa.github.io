I am an Assistant Professor in Sociology at [Columbia University](https://sociology.columbia.edu/) and a member of the [Data Science Institute](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu). I use causal inference and machine learning to conduct research on urban inequality, violence, and public health.  My work has been published in the *American Sociological Review*, *Child Development*, *Demography*, *Eastern Economic Journal*, *Housing Policy Debate*, the *Journal of Housing Economics*, the *Journal of Urban Economics*, and the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. Findings from my research have been featured in [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/upshot/the-unsung-role-that-ordinary-citizens-played-in-the-great-crime-decline.html), [*The Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/20/how-violence-shapes-children-for-life/), [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-12/pssst-crime-may-be-near-an-all-time-low), and [*CityLab*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-22/the-impact-of-violent-crime-on-economic-mobility).   
I received my PhD in Sociology from New York University in 2019, a Masterâ€™s in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2014, and a BS in Engineering from Polytechnic University of Catalonia in 2004. Before graduate school, I was a firefighter at [Barcelona  Fire Department](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/bombers/en).
