I am an Assistant Professor in [Sociology at Columbia University](https://sociology.columbia.edu/) and a member of the [Data Science Institute](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu). I use causal inference and machine learning methods to study urban inequality, violence, and racial disparities in policing.  My work has been published in the *American Journal of Sociology*, *American Sociological Review*, *Demography*, the *Journal of Urban Economics*, *PLOS One*, and the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, among other peer-reviewed journals. Findings from my research have been featured in *[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/upshot/the-unsung-role-that-ordinary-citizens-played-in-the-great-crime-decline.html)*, *[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/20/how-violence-shapes-children-for-life/)*, and *[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-12/pssst-crime-may-be-near-an-all-time-low)*.  I received my PhD in Sociology from [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/sociology.html) in 2019, a Master’s in Public Policy from the [Harvard Kennedy School of Government](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/) in 2014, and a BS in Engineering from the [Polytechnic University of Catalonia](https://epseb.upc.edu/en) in 2004. Before graduate school, I was a firefighter at [Barcelona  Fire Department](https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/bombers/en) from 2007 to 2011. In my free time, I enjoy [running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/456521144/statistics), cycling, and hiking.
