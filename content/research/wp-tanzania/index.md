# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: School-based violence prevention interventions offer enormous potential to reduce children’s experience of violence perpetrated by teachers, but few have been tested globally and none in emergency settings. We tested whether the EmpaTeach intervention could reduce physical violence from teachers to students in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp, Tanzania. We conducted a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with parallel assignment, registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03745573. A complete sample of all 27 primary and secondary schools in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp were approached and agreed to participate in the study.  All students in grades two and above, and all teachers, who spoke either Kiswahili or Kirundi and could provide informed consent were eligible to participate in cross-sectional baseline, midline and endline surveys in November 2018, May 2019, and January 2020. A total of 14 schools were randomly assigned to receive the intervention in January-March 2019. Allocation was not concealed due to the nature of the intervention. The primary outcome was students’ self-reported experience of physical violence from teachers, assessed at midline using a modified version of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child Institutional. Secondary outcomes included student reports of emotional violence, depressive symptoms and school attendance.  Analyses were by intention to treat, and were adjusted for clustering within schools and for stratification factors

**Background**. School-based violence prevention interventions offer enormous potential to reduce children’s experience of violence perpetrated by teachers, but few have been tested globally and none in emergency settings. We tested whether the EmpaTeach intervention could reduce physical violence from teachers to students in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp, Tanzania.

**Methods**. We conducted a two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial with parallel assignment, registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03745573. A complete sample of all 27 primary and secondary schools in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp were approached and agreed to participate in the study.  All students in grades two and above, and all teachers, who spoke either Kiswahili or Kirundi and could provide informed consent were eligible to participate in cross-sectional baseline, midline and endline surveys in November 2018, May 2019, and January 2020. A total of 14 schools were randomly assigned to receive the intervention in January-March 2019. Allocation was not concealed due to the nature of the intervention. The primary outcome was students’ self-reported experience of physical violence from teachers, assessed at midline using a modified version of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child Institutional. Secondary outcomes included student reports of: emotional violence, depressive symptoms and school attendance.  Analyses were by intention to treat, and were adjusted for clustering within schools and for stratification factors.

**Findings**. No schools left the study. A total of 1619 out of 1978 (81.9%) randomly sampled students approached for participation took part in the midline survey; 1617 of 2032 (79.6%) participated at endline. Prevalence of past week violence at midline was similar in intervention (408 of 839, 48.6%) and control schools (412 of 777, 53.0%; aRR=0.91, 95%CI 0.80 to 1.02, p=0.106). No secondary outcome differed significantly between arms. A camp-wide educational policy change during intervention implementation resulted in 14.7% of teachers receiving a compressed version of the intervention, but exploratory analyses showed no difference in our primary outcome by level of school compliance. No adverse events related to the intervention were detected, but 853 of 4729 (18.0%) students interviewed at either baseline, midline, or endline were referred to child protective services in the Camp because they disclosed experience of abuse during data collection. 

**Interpretation**. There is no evidence that the EmpaTeach intervention effectively reduces physical violence from teachers towards primary or secondary school students in Nyarugusu Refugee Camp
