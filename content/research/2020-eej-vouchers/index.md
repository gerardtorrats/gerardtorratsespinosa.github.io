# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  Using restricted administrative data on the voucher program, we examine the experience of voucher holders in metropolitan areas with rising rents. While some of our models suggest that rising rents in metropolitan areas are associated with a slight increase in rent-to-income ratios among voucher holders, poor renters in general see significantly larger increases in rent-to-income ratios. We see little evidence that rising rents push voucher holders to worse neighborhoods, with voucher holders in central cities ending up in lower poverty neighborhoods as rents rise. It appears that vouchers may help low-income households remain in neighborhoods as they gentrify. These analyses suggest that vouchers help to partially insulate low-income households from gentrification and the rising rents recently seen in many cities around the country. Voucher holders are not immune to the effects of increasing rents, however. As rents rise in a metropolitan area, voucher holders move more often and face slightly higher rent burdens, especially in the tight markets of the West coast. But the increases in rent to income ratios they experience with higher rents are significantly smaller than those felt by poor renters as a whole. Further, voucher holders whose initial rents fall below the local payment standard see no increase in rent burden as rents rise.
